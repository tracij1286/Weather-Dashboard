# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

The motivation for this assignment was to test my knowledge of Javascript fundamentals learned in bootcamp.
I built this project to see how far my skills have come in grasping APA's in Javascript.  
The problem this project solves is delivering the Weather report to users and storing the locations searched.
I learned to utilize javascript elements, functions and strings and how to store locally. It's been a large learning curve but i'm hanging in there!
